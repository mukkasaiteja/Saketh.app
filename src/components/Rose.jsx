   rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[1] in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[1] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[2] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.

   <li>Choose the right rose varieties: Select rose varieties that are suitable for your climate, soil type, and personal preferences. There are numerous types of roses, including hybrid teas, floribundas, climbers, and shrub roses. Consider factors such as flower color, fragrance, disease resistance, and growth habit when making your selection.</li>
   <li>Select a suitable location: Roses require a location that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. Choose a spot with well-drained soil and good air circulation. Avoid areas with excessive shade or competition from other plants.</li>
   <li>
   Prepare the soil: Prior to planting, prepare the soil by removing weeds, rocks, and debris. Roses prefer fertile, loamy soil with good drainage. Amend the soil with organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve its texture and fertility.
   </li>
   <li>
   Planting: Dig a hole that is wide and deep enough to accommodate the rose's roots. Place the rose plant in the hole, ensuring that the bud union (the swollen area where the rose is grafted onto the rootstock) is level with or slightly above the soil surface. Backfill the hole with soil, firming it gently around the roots.
   </li>
   <li>
   Watering: Roses require regular and consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Water deeply, aiming for the roots to receive about 1 inch of water per week. Avoid overhead watering, as wet foliage can encourage fungal diseases. Mulching around the base of the plant helps retain moisture and suppress weeds.
