        Mango trees grow to 30–40 metres (98–131 feet) tall, with a crown radius of 10–15 m (33–49 ft). The trees are long-lived, as some specimens still fruit after 300 years.[10]

In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m (20 ft), with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and anchor roots penetrating deeply into the soil.[1] The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres (6–14 inches) long, and 6–16 cm (2+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to a dark, glossy red, then dark green as they mature.[1] The flowers are produced in terminal panicles 10–40 cm (4–15+1⁄2 in) long; each flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a mild, sweet fragrance.[1] Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known,[1] many of which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop.[11] The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to ripening.[1]

        <li>Choose the right variety: Select a mango variety that is suitable for your climate and growing conditions. There are different varieties of mangoes, each with its own requirements and tolerance to temperature and humidity.</li>
        <li>Optimal planting location: Mango plants thrive in full sunlight, so choose a location that receives at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Ensure the soil is well-draining to avoid waterlogged conditions.</li>
        <li>
        Soil preparation: Prepare the soil before planting by loosening it and adding organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure. This helps improve drainage and provides essential nutrients for healthy growth.
        </li>
        <li>
        Adequate spacing: Mango trees can grow quite large, so ensure you provide enough space between each tree for proper growth and air circulation. The exact spacing will depend on the specific variety you're growing.
        </li>
        <li>
        Watering: Water newly planted mango trees regularly to help establish the roots. Once established, mango trees are somewhat drought-tolerant, but they still require regular watering, especially during flowering and fruiting seasons. Water deeply but avoid waterlogging the soil.
