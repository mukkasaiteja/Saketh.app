   Tomato plants are vines, initially decumbent, typically growing 180 cm (6 ft) or more above the ground if supported, although erect bush varieties have been bred, generally 100 cm (3 ft 3 in) tall or shorter. Indeterminate types are "tender" perennials, dying annually in temperate climates (they are originally native to tropical highlands), although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some cases. Determinate types are annual in all climates.[citation needed]

Tomato plants are dicots, and grow as a series of branching stems, with a terminal bud at the tip that does the actual growing. When the tip eventually stops growing, whether because of pruning or flowering, lateral buds take over and grow into other, fully functional, vines.[9][self-published source?]

   <li>Choose the right tomato varieties: Select tomato varieties that suit your growing conditions and preferences. Consider factors such as size, flavor, disease resistance, and whether they are determinate (bushy) or indeterminate (vining).</li>
   <li>OStart with healthy seedlings: If growing tomatoes from seed, start them indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date in your area. Use high-quality seed-starting mix and provide adequate light and warmth. Transplant the seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed.</li>
   <li>
   Provide a sunny location: Tomatoes thrive in full sun, so choose a location that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Good exposure to sunlight helps in fruit development and improves flavor.
   </li>
   <li>
   Prepare the soil: Enrich the soil with organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure before planting. This improves soil fertility, drainage, and moisture retention.
   </li>
   <li>
   Proper spacing: Plant tomato seedlings at the appropriate spacing, typically 2-3 feet apart, depending on the variety. Proper spacing allows for good air circulation and prevents the spread of diseases.
