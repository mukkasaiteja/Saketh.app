        Potato plants are herbaceous perennials that grow about 60 cm (24 in) high, depending on variety, with the leaves dying back after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. They bear white, pink, red, blue, or purple flowers with yellow stamens. Potatoes are mostly cross-pollinated by insects such as bumblebees, which carry pollen from other potato plants, though a substantial amount of self-fertilizing occurs as well. Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.

        <li>Start with certified seed potatoes: Purchase certified seed potatoes from a reputable supplier. Avoid using store-bought potatoes, as they may carry diseases or have been treated to prevent sprouting.</li>
        <li>Optimal planting location: Mango plants thrive in full sunlight, so choose a location that receives at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Ensure the soil is well-draining to avoid waterlogged conditions.</li>
        <li>
        Prepare the soil: Potatoes prefer loose, well-draining soil with plenty of organic matter. Prepare the soil by removing any weeds, rocks, or debris. Amend the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and drainage.
        </li>
        <li>
        Plant at the right time: Plant potatoes when the soil has warmed up and all chances of frost have passed. The ideal soil temperature for planting is around 45 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit (7 to 13 degrees Celsius).
        </li>
        <li>
        Planting method: Potatoes can be planted directly in the ground or in containers. If planting in the ground, create furrows or trenches about 4-6 inches deep and place the seed potatoes cut-side down with eyes facing up, spacing them about 12-15 inches apart. If using containers, choose a large container and plant 2-3 seed potatoes per container.
