Hibiscus flower
Flower colour in certain species, such as H. mutabilis and H. tiliaceus, changes with age. The fruit is a dry five-lobed capsule, containing several seeds in each lobe, which are released when the capsule dehisces (splits open) at maturity. It is of red and white colours. It is an example of complete flowers.

   <li>Location: Choose a sunny spot for your hibiscus plant, as they thrive in full sunlight. Ensure it gets at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day.</li>
   <li>Soil: Hibiscus plants prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. Use a mixture of potting soil, compost, and perlite to provide good drainage.</li>
   <li>
   Watering: Water your hibiscus plant regularly to keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy. Avoid overwatering or allowing the plant to sit in standing water.
   </li>
   <li>
   Fertilization: Feed your hibiscus plant with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package for proper application.</li>
   <li>
   Pruning: Regularly prune your hibiscus plant to encourage bushier growth and more blooms. Remove dead or diseased branches and trim back leggy growth to maintain a compact shape.
